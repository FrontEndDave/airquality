AQI values are presented on a scale that informs about the level of risk, allowing users to make informed decisions about outdoor activities.",

        "title": "Particulate Matter PM10",
        "description": "PM10 particles are less than 10 micrometers in diameter and can settle in the upper respiratory tract and bronchi, causing coughing, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties, especially during physical exertion. They increase the risk of respiratory infections and can worsen allergy symptoms such as asthma or conjunctivitis."

        "title": "Fine Particulate Matter PM2.5",
        "description": "Fine particulate matter PM2.5, with a diameter below 2.5 micrometers, can penetrate the lower respiratory tract and bloodstream, increasing the risk of heart diseases, such as hypertension and heart attack, and lung cancer. PM2.5 particles, like PM10, can cause coughing, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties, especially during physical exertion."

        "title": "Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)",
        "description": "NO2 is a gas primarily generated from fuel combustion, and its presence in the air can irritate the respiratory tract. Long-term exposure can lead to chronic respiratory diseases and increase the risk of lung infections. NO2 may also worsen asthma symptoms and negatively affect children's development."

        "title": "Ozone (O3)",
        "description": "Ozone is a gas that protects us from UV radiation in the upper atmosphere, but at ground level, it can be harmful. Inhaling ozone can lead to respiratory tract irritation, coughing, and difficulty breathing, especially for people with respiratory diseases. High ozone concentrations can also reduce lung capacity and affect heart health."

        "title": "Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)",
        "description": "SO2 is a gas emitted during fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes. It can cause respiratory tract irritation, coughing, and worsen asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease symptoms. Long-term exposure to SO2 may lead to lung diseases and increase the risk of heart disease."

        "title": "Carbon Monoxide (CO)",
        "description": "Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuels. It is dangerous because it can bind with hemoglobin in the blood, leading to oxygen deprivation. Symptoms of CO poisoning include headaches, dizziness, weakness, and, in extreme cases, can be fatal. People with heart and respiratory diseases are particularly vulnerable to CO's negative effects."
